# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Adham  
**AI & Data Science Professional | Building Real-World ML Solutions**

Currently deepening my expertise through the **DEPI AI & Data Science Scholarship** and **Machine Learning training at ICT Hub**, where I work on advanced machine learning pipelines, model evaluation, and data-driven decision systems.

My core strengths include supervised learning, feature selection, model optimization, and data preprocessing â€” with practical experience in using tools like scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy to develop accurate, explainable models.

**Recent work includes:**  
â€¢ Fraud Detection System â€“ ML pipeline with Genetic Algorithm feature selection on imbalanced financial data.  
â€¢ Diabetes Prediction Model â€“ Classification model with preprocessing, scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.  
*These are part of a broader set of applied AI projects built to solve real-world challenges.*

I'm passionate about using AI not just for prediction, but for insight â€” transforming raw data into intelligent systems that solve meaningful problems.
